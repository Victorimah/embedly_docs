## Security Best Practices

<Steps>

  <Step title="1. Secure Token Management">
    **API tokens** are used to authenticate your requests to Edge, and it’s crucial to handle them securely:

    - **Store Tokens Securely**: Use environment variables or a secure vault for storing your tokens. Avoid hardcoding tokens directly into your codebase.
    - **Rotate Tokens Regularly**: Periodically rotate your tokens to reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
    - **Limit Token Scope**: Issue tokens with the minimum permissions necessary for your use case.

    <Tooltip tip="Token management involves securely storing, using, and rotating API tokens to prevent unauthorized access to your systems.">
      Why is token management important?
    </Tooltip>

    <Warning>
      If a token is exposed or compromised, revoke it immediately through the Edge Dashboard to prevent unauthorized access.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Use Data Encryption">
    Edge supports **AES 256-bit encryption** for securing data transfers in the production environment:

    - **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Ensure that any personal or financial information is encrypted before it’s sent to Edge.
    - **Include Encryption Headers**: When making API calls, add the `X-Encryption-Type: AES256` header to indicate that the request is encrypted.
    - **Use TLS/HTTPS**: All API requests to Edge should use **TLS (Transport Layer Security)** to encrypt data during transmission, ensuring it cannot be intercepted.

    <Tooltip tip="AES 256-bit encryption is a standard used for securing sensitive data, making it nearly impossible to decrypt without the correct key.">

    <Info>
      Data encryption protects your sensitive information both in transit and at rest, reducing the risk of data breaches.

  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Implement Strong User Authentication">
    Ensure that both internal users (e.g., administrators) and external users (e.g., customers) are authenticated securely:

    - **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require MFA for all admin access to the Edge Dashboard.
    - **Enforce Strong Passwords**: Implement password policies that require a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.
    - **Monitor Login Attempts**: Track failed login attempts and consider implementing account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks.

    <Tooltip tip="Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide more than one verification factor to access their accounts.">
      What is MFA?
    </Tooltip>

    <Warning>
      Weak authentication can expose your integration to unauthorized access. Always require strong passwords and MFA for secure access.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Monitor and Log API Activity">
    Regularly monitoring your API activity helps you detect and respond to suspicious behavior:

    - **Enable API Logs**: Use the Edge Dashboard to enable detailed logging of API requests, responses, and errors.
    - **Set Up Alerts**: Create alerts for abnormal activities like repeated failed login attempts, unusual transaction volumes, or access from unknown IP addresses.
    - **Regularly Review Logs**: Perform periodic reviews of API logs to ensure that no unauthorized activity has occurred.

    <Tooltip tip="Logging and monitoring help track API activity and can be critical for detecting and responding to security incidents.">
      Why is logging important?
    </Tooltip>

    <Info>
      API logging and monitoring provide visibility into how your integration is being used, allowing you to take action quickly if an issue arises.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="5. Implement Incident Response Procedures">
    Preparing for potential security incidents helps minimize the impact on your business and users:

    - **Define an Incident Response Plan**: Create a plan that outlines the steps to take if a security incident occurs, including whom to notify and how to contain the issue.
    - **Train Your Team**: Ensure that your team is trained on the incident response procedures and knows how to use the tools available for security monitoring.
    - **Conduct Regular Drills**: Run regular security drills to test your incident response plan and improve your team’s readiness.

    <Tooltip tip="An incident response plan provides a structured approach to managing security incidents, reducing the time and impact of a breach.">

    <Warning>
      A slow or ineffective response to a security incident can result in significant data loss and damage to your reputation.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

## Security Tips for Developers

<Tip>
  Use environment variables or secure vaults for storing API keys and secrets, keeping them out of source code repositories.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Regularly audit your API keys and user access levels to ensure that no unnecessary permissions are granted.
</Tip>

<Info>
  Remember to update your encryption keys periodically and monitor access logs for any unusual activity to maintain a secure integration.

## Common Security Risks to Avoid

- **Exposed Tokens**: Accidentally exposing tokens in public repositories can result in unauthorized access to your API. Always use `.env` files or secure storage solutions.
- **Weak Authentication**: Not enforcing strong passwords or MFA can lead to unauthorized access. Implement robust authentication mechanisms for all users.
- **Failure to Monitor API Activity**: Without proper logging and monitoring, you may not detect unauthorized access until it’s too late. Always enable and review logs.

<Warning>
Neglecting security practices can put your business and your users' data at risk. Always prioritize security when integrating with Edge.
